            <h1> Something to note:</h1>
            <p>
                Anytime I refer to "modern hardware" when talking about emulators for newer systems, assume I'm talking about a system that has an Intel i5-7600k or Ryzen 3600 CPU, and GTX 960 or RX 570 GPU.
            </p>

            <h1> NES </h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://fceux.com/web/home.html" target="_blank"> FCEUX</a>, <br>
                <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/nestopiaue/files/" target="_blank"> Nestopia UE</a>, and <br>
                <a href="https://www.mesen.ca/" target="_blank"> Mesen</a> are all great options, <br>
                I'd recommend FCEUX, but really any will do, experiment and see which one you like the most! Interestingly, Mesen supports HD texture packs for NES games, kinda neat if you're into that.
            </p>

            <h1> SNES </h1>
            <p> 
                <a href="https://github.com/bsnes-emu/bsnes/releases" target="_blank"> bsnes</a> is by far the best and most accurate, but can be kind of demanding on hardware. <br>
                <a href="https://github.com/snes9xgit/snes9x/releases" target="_blank"> Snes9x</a> is also very accurate, but much more friendly to older/lower power hardware, use this one on your Raspberry Pi!
            </p>

            <h1> N64 </h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/Rosalie241/RMG/releases" target="_blank"> RMG</a>, use this, it's easy and accurate enough. Alternatively, <br>
                <a href="https://github.com/simple64/simple64/releases" target="_blank"> Simple64</a> is supposedly pretty good, haven't used it as much. <br>
                RMG and Simple64 both have the same core, that being Mupen64Plus-Next, so they should run games near identically, and it really comes down to which UI you prefer.
                Feel free to try both!
            </p>

            <h1> GameCube/Wii </h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/" target="_blank"> Dolphin</a> is your only option, runs well. <br>
                The reason Dolphin emulates both GameCube and Wii is because architecturally the Wii is like, literally an overclocked GameCube with more RAM.
            </p>

            <h1> Wii U </h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://cemu.info/" target="_blank"> Cemu</a> is your only option, runs well on modern hardware, and is fairly impressive. <br>
            </p>

            <h1> Switch </h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/" target="_blank"> Yuzu</a> is easier to setup, while <br>
                <a href="https://ryujinx.org/" target="_blank"> Ryujinx</a> boasts higher game compatibility, and slight better performance, however both run great on modern hardwar. <br>
                Switch emulators need a system firmware dump to run.
            </p>

            <h1> GB/GBC </h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://sameboy.github.io/" target="_blank"> SameBoy</a> is what I've always used, it's simple and easy to setup. Highly accurate.
            </p>

            <h1> GBA </h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://mgba.io/" target="_blank"> mGBA</a> is the only good option, easy enough to setup, decent accuracy.
            </p>

            <h1> DS</h1>
            <p>
                DS emulation isn't very polished yet, but out of all there is, <br>
                <a href="https://melonds.kuribo64.net/downloads.php" target="_blank"> MelonDS</a> is defintely one of the most polished options around right now. <br>
                <a href="https://desmume.org/download/" target="_blank"> DeSmuME</a> is also a pretty solid choice, but I personally prefer MelonDS.
            </p>

            <h1> 3DS</h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://citra-emu.org/" target="_blank"> Citra</a> is your only choice, still kind of experimental, but polished enough. Runs best on modern hardware.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you want to emulate a more obscure Nintendo system such as the Virtual Boy, I'd suggest researching on the <a href="https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank"> Emulation General Wiki</a>.
