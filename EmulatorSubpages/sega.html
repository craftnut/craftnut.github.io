            <h1> Master System/Game Gear </h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://emulicious.net/" target="_blank"> Emulicious</a> is what I've used in the past, very easy to setup. <br>
                The Game Gear was literally a handheld Master System, so most Master System emulators can play both.
            </p>

            <h1> Genesis </h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Genesis_Plus_GX" target="_blank"> Genesis Plus GX</a> is the best and Genesis emulator, but it's only available on RetroArch. I think you should still give it a shot, 
                but if you strongly prefer standalone emulators, <br>
                <a href="https://www.emuparadise.me/emulators/files/user/Fusion364-285.zip" target="_blank"> Kega Fusion</a> is just OK, albeit outdated and no longer the most accurate, but it's useable.
            </p>

            <h1> Saturn </h1>
            <p>
                I don't know enough about Saturn to recommend one, <a href="https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Sega_Saturn_emulators"> please read here</a> if you need a Saturn emulator.
            </p>

            <h1> Dreamcast </h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://flyinghead.github.io/flycast-builds/" target="_blank"> Flycast</a> is the best option, and only one you should consider. It's very easy to use and doesn't need BIOS.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you want to emulate more obscure Sega systems, I'd suggest researching on the <a href="https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank"> Emulation General Wiki</a>.
