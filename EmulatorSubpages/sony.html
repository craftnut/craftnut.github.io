            <h1> PSX </h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.duckstation.org/" target="_blank"> DuckStation</a> is by far the best option, and the only you should consider. It's very fast, easy, and accurate. It also has many graphical enhancement options. <br>
                All PSX emulators need BIOS files.
            </p>

            <h1> PS2 </h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://pcsx2.net/" target="_blank"> PCSX2</a> is in the same situation as DuckStation, don't use anything else. <br>
                All PS2 emulators need BIOS files.
            </p>

            <h1> PS3 </h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://rpcs3.net/" target="_blank"> RPCS3</a> is your only option. It's still very experimental and requires a modern (2021+) high-end PC. I'd only recommend it for more advanced users. <br>
                RPCS3 requires PS3 firmware files which can be obtained fron Sony's PS3 update webpage.
            </p>

            <h1> PSP </h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.ppsspp.org/" target="_blank"> PPSSPP</a> is the only option you should really consider, very polished and easy to use. Does not require BIOS files and is easy to run.
            </p>

            <h1> PS Vita/TV</h1>
            <p>
                <a href="https://vita3k.org/" target="_blank"> Vita3K</a> is your only option, should be light enough of hardware, but is still very experimental. I'd only recommend this one to advanced users.
