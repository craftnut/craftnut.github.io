                Very up to date and well maintained wiki about everything emulation. Is extremely comprehensive, and has a page that can help you find ROMs and BIOS.

                Cross-platform frontend for "LibRetro Cores", basically every emulator you'd need all in a console UI. Some people really like this, I strongly prefer keeping all my emulators seperate, also stand-alone emulators
                are far easier to configure imo. RetroArch has a steep learning curve, but may be worth it if you own a <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/" target="_blank"> Steam Deck</a> or similar handheld. (BTW, if you don't already own a Steam Deck,
                BUY ONE WHEN YOU CAN, it's like a Switch on 50 steroids, I love mine!)

                If you're interested in repurposing something like a Wii or 3DS as an emulation box, I have videos covering that sort of thing and much more, I may also put something out about how I emulate on my Steam Deck in the future.
