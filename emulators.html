            <p class="which"> But Why? </p>

            <p> 
                As real hardware starts to fail, the only way to preserve retro games will be emulation. Clearly, by the presence of lost media content on YouTube today, media preservation is still very tricky, 
                so you can help preserve obscure old games by saving copies of the ones you want to play on your computer! But you didn't hear it from me...

            <p class="which"> So which should I use? </p>

            <p>
                In these subpages I will recommend some popular emulators I like for systems which I have a good amount of knowledge about, and only free ones, no paid or freemium trash. <br>
                It is important that these are just my recommendations, This page would also be useful as a supplement to your own research!
